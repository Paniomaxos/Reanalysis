Project Description - Malta.ipynb

In the notebook Malta.ipynb, I have conducted data analysis and addressed the questions outlined in the problem statement. The project includes:

Data Analysis:

Exploration of the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
Visualization of data using tools like matplotlib and seaborn to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.
Data Manipulation:

Use of libraries like pandas and numpy for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
Machine Learning Implementation:

Development of a predictive model to forecast house prices based on the provided features.
Specifically, the ETCN model has been utilized to perform forecasting and achieve accurate predictions.
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis and machine learning,
leveraging advanced tools and methodologies to extract insights and deliver actionable results.
